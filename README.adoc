Assistify <info@assistify.de>
v1.0, 2017-12-07

Integrates Assistify into Atlassian's popular wiki-platform

== Use Case

The request mode of Assistify should be triggered inside the user's context
E.g. directly from a SAP system or a confluence instance where the question comes up.
This confluence user macro provides a form that opens the pre-filled request dialog within Assistiy by submitting the form.

The input form is provided by this macro and can be placed on each Wiki page.

== How it works

By submitting the form the input values are passed to Assistify as request parameters of a specific URL:

```
https://${baseUrl}/create-channel/?topic=${topic-input-value}&title=${title-input-value}&question=${question-input-value}
```

After submit this form Assistify request dialog opens in a new browser tab
